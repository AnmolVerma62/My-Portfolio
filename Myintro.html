                        <br> I am an immediate joiner and eager to put my knowledge and experience to work for my clients, I have honed my skills to develop user-friendly and visually appealing websites. I recently completed my Bachelor of Arts degree from Kurukshetra University, and while my results are awaited, I am confident that my education has prepared me well for a career in web development.
                        
                        I have always been interested in technology and its applications, which is why I chose to pursue a career in web development. My academic record speaks to my dedication and hard work, with a 50.2% result in commerce stream from G.B.S Public School and an impressive 80.6% result from Sir Jawahar Singh Public School in 10th class.
                            
                        I believe that my passion for web development, combined with my technical skills and educational background, make me a strong candidate for any web development project. I am excited to use my skills and experience to bring your vision to life and create a website that not only looks great, but also functions seamlessly for your users.
                        
                        I also had the opportunity to gain hands-on experience through a 2-month web development internship at YHILLS. I am excited to showcase my skills and projects in web development and I hope you find them impressive.
